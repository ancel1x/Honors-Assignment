          <h3>Analysis of E-Train Graphs</h3>
        <p>When it came to walkability score and public schools rankings, a higher walkability score correlated with higher public schools rankings. You can see this as the walkability score on the graph increases as the public schools ranking goes higher. This is most likely due to having more accessibility and easier access to educational resources like libraries. As for average age and rent, the data points were all over the place suggesting there wasn’t any strong correlation. However, when it came to walkability score and rent, a higher walkability score led to higher prices in median rent. This is due to people basically paying extra for convenience, time savings, health benefits, and access to a variety of amenities.

          <h3>Analysis of 7-Train Graphs</h3>
        <p>Between walkability, age, and rent, they all have some correlations. The lower age group (30-40) lives in areas with high walkability scores and higher rent, while the higher age group (40+) lives in areas with high walkability scores and lower rent. My theory as to why is because of job opportunities, where the lower age group have better chances at getting jobs with higher pay, which can cover the cost of high rent. Both age groups chose areas with high walkability score as means of convenience. The scores remain rather consistent between walkability and rent.
